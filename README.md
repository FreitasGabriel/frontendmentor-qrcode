### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### Useful resources

- [Margin collapse on tag p](https://pt.stackoverflow.com/questions/2535/n%C3%A3o-consigo-definir-margin-top-bottom-right-para-elemento-block-por-qu%C3%AA) - This helped me when I needed to put a margin in p tag. I discover that i needed to put an `overflow:hidden` in main tag, to avoid that p tag had a margin collapse.
